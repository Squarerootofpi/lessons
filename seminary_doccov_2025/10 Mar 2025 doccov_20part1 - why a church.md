## Why Does the Savior Have a Church?

Read the following statements and ponder reasons why the Savior has a Church.

- The restored Church of Jesus Christ has been established to teach the fulness of His doctrine and to officiate with His priesthood authority to perform the ordinances necessary to enter the kingdom of God. Members who forgo Church attendance and rely only on individual spirituality separate themselves from these gospel essentials: the power and blessings of the priesthood, the fulness of restored doctrine, and the motivations and opportunities to apply that doctrine. (Dallin H. Oaks, “The Need for a Church,” Liahona, Nov. 2021, 25)
- Following the apostasy and disintegration of the Church He had organized while on the earth, the Lord reestablished the Church of Jesus Christ once again through the Prophet Joseph Smith. The ancient purpose remains: that is, to preach the good news of the gospel of Jesus Christ and administer the ordinances of salvation—in other words, to bring people to Christ. And now, through the instrumentality of this restored Church, the promise of redemption is placed within reach even of the spirits of the dead who in their mortal lifetime knew little or nothing of the Savior’s grace. (D. Todd Christofferson, “Why the Church,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2015, 108)

When the Church was organized in April 1830, the Book of Mormon had recently been published for the
first time. In Doctrine and Covenants 20:9–36, the Lord emphasized many of the truths that are taught in the
Book of Mormon.

Study the following sets of verses, looking for important truths the Savior taught about Himself and His
doctrine. Consider using the footnotes for these scriptures to help discover important information.

- Doctrine and Covenants 20:8–15 (The Book of Mormon and its role in the Restoration)
- Doctrine and Covenants 20:17–25 (The plan of salvation)

Choose two or more of the truths you studied. Write down why you think it would be important for these truths to be emphasized as the Church was being established.
