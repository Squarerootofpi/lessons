# Personal study about worth

## Option 1:

Study about the Atonement of Jesus Christ and ponder His love for you. You could read some of the following
verses: Isaiah 53:3–5; Luke 22:41–44; John 3:16–17; 1 Corinthians 6:11, 19–20; Alma 7:7, 10–13. You could also
find different verses to study.

Consider recording cross-references you want to remember. You could note them in your scriptures next to
Doctrine and Covenants 18:10–11, write them in your study journal, or use your Gospel Library app to create
tags or links.

## Option 2:

Study what Church leaders have taught about our worth to God. Use Gospel Library or other resources to find
relevant statements or talks. You could search for terms like “worth” or “God’s love” to help you find resources.
The following statement by Sister Joy D. Jones, former Primary General President, is one example of what you
might find.

"Let me point out the need to differentiate between two critical words: worth and worthiness. They are not the same. Spiritual worth means to value ourselves the way Heavenly Father values us, not as the world values us. Our worth was determined before we ever came to this earth. “God’s love is infinite and it will endure forever.”

"On the other hand, worthiness is achieved through obedience. If we sin, we are less worthy, but we are never worth less! We continue to repent and strive to be like Jesus with our worth intact. As President Brigham Young taught: “The least, the most inferior spirit now upon the earth. . . is worth worlds.” No matter what, we always have worth in the eyes of our Heavenly Father." (Joy D. Jones, “Value beyond Measure,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2017, 14)
