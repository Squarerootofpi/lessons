#### President Nelson's Quote: 
"... You need to understand three fundamental truths that will help you prepare your future course:
- First, know the truth about who you are.
- Second, know the truth about what Heavenly Father and His Son have offered you.
- And third, know the truth related to your conversion."

# Group Instructions: 
1. Assign one person to act as scribe (they can just use their phone)
2. Individually, read and ponder the paragraphs assigned to your group, looking for truths. You will have a few minutes to do this. 
3. Steed will tell you to go to the next step. If you get bored before this, feel free to read more of the talk. Or fall asleep ðŸ˜‰.
4. Going in a circle, each of you say a truth/principle that you learned and categorize it according to President Nelson's categories, until you don't have any more. 
5. The scribe writes down the truth or principle and its category in their notes. 
6. The scribe writes the truths on the whiteboard. If someone has already written it down, don't write it.
