### Resources Used: 

#### President Nelson's Devotional (from May): 
"... You need to understand three fundamental truths that will help you prepare your future course:
- First, know the truth about who you are.
- Second, know the truth about what Heavenly Father and His Son have offered you.
- And third, know the truth related to your conversion."

## Our Purposes and Identities

[President Russell M. Nelson (Paragraphs 37-39)](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults/2022/05/12nelson?lang=eng&id=37-39#37)

#### Our Three Core Identities

> First and foremost, you are a child of God.

>Second, as a member of the Church, you are a child of the covenant. And third, you are a disciple of Jesus Christ.

#### The Importance of Those Identities

>Tonight, I plead with you not to replace these three paramount and unchanging identifiers with any others, because doing so could stymie your progress or pigeonhole you in a stereotype that could potentially thwart your eternal progression.

[President Russell M. Nelson (Paragraphs 48-49)](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/broadcasts/worldwide-devotional-for-young-adults/2022/05/12nelson?lang=eng&id=48-49#48)

> Any identifier that is not compatible with these three basic designations will ultimately let you down. Other labels will disappoint you in time because they do not have the power to lead you toward eternal life in the celestial kingdom of God.

> Worldly identifiers will never give you a vision of who you can ultimately become. They will never affirm your divine DNA or your unlimited, divine potential.

## The Significance of Scripture Study

[Elder Mark L. Pace (Paragraphs 6-7)](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/04/54pace?lang=eng&id=6-7#6)

> That is the miracle we seek—when one person has an experience in the scriptures and that experience is blessed by the influence of the Holy Ghost. Such experiences are precious foundation stones for our conversion to the Savior. And as President Russell M. Nelson recently reminded us, spiritual foundations must be constantly reinforced. Long-lasting conversion is a lifelong process. Conversion is our goal.

> To be most effective, your experiences with the scriptures must be your own. Reading or hearing about another person’s experiences and insights can be helpful, but that won’t bring the same converting power. There is no substitute for the time you spend in the scriptures, hearing the Holy Ghost speak directly to you.

[Elder Mark L. Pace (Paragraphs 22-27)](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/04/54pace?lang=eng&id=22-27#22)

> When the Lord’s living prophet, President Nelson, introduced us to Come, Follow Me as a means of studying the scriptures, he invited us to transform our homes into sanctuaries of faith and centers of gospel learning.

> Then he promised four specific blessings:

> 1. your Sabbath days will be a delight,

> 2. your children will be excited to learn and live the Savior’s teachings,

> 3. the influence of the adversary in your life and in your home will decrease, and

> 4. these changes in your family will be dramatic and sustaining.


### Perhaps with time:

[Elder Mark L. Pace (Paragraphs 41)](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2022/04/54pace?lang=eng&id=41#41)

> When we study the scriptures, there is no spiritual famine in the land. As Nephi said, “Whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction” (1 Nephi 15:24).
