# Role Play Rallies

We may do these as a class, but this takes longer.
Role play rally: 
- As a class, pick a topic or a question we want (1)
- Create the scenario (1 min)
- Class peeps demos it (4 min)
- Discuss (2 min)
- Partner up, prep, role plays and discussion (10 minutes)
- Discuss as class (1-5 min)


# Roleplay Scenarios

In each of these scenarios, there is something you need to share or testify of or explain or do that might be more difficult to do in the moment. There will generally be a short period of preparation to make sure that you are ready before the role play, and to plan what you're going to do or say during the role play.

You **probably** will have some even better ideas than these below. Feel free to use those. If you have something that worked well that's not on here, let me know. I'll add it to the list. :smile:

## Good faith roleplays


### You have invited someone to church, how do you prepare them?

## Ooh that's a little more awkward roleplays

### Someone just wants to argue, be right, or smash on your beliefs.

**Scenario:** You are talking with someone (maybe online or in person) who isn't asking questions to understand, but seems determined to prove you wrong, mock your beliefs, or pick a fight about Church teachings or history.

**Preparation Focus:** How can you respond with kindness and testimony, without getting drawn into contention? What are your boundaries for this kind of conversation?

**Consider Your Approach:**
- Focus on maintaining a spirit of peace, not contention (3 Nephi 11:29).
- Respond with kindness and respect, even if it's not reciprocated (Proverbs 15:1).
- Avoid point-by-point debate; it rarely convinces and often fuels anger.
- Share simple, heartfelt testimony of core beliefs rather than complex arguments.
- Know when it's appropriate to politely end or redirect the conversation if it remains purely argumentative. ("I see we disagree strongly, perhaps we could discuss this another time when we can both be more understanding," or "I'm happy to share what I believe, but I'm not comfortable arguing.")
- Have or practice an exit strategy or statement that will allow you to leave, and you feel comfortable leaving on, even in the person still doesn't want you to leave.
- Remember you are responsible for *how* you share, not for forcing acceptance.

**Potential Resources:**

**Potential Invitations or Next Steps (Use Discernment):**

- Offer continued friendship on other terms.
- Silently pray for them.

### Someone asks about what you think about the Trinity and if you believe in it.

**Scenario:** Someone familiar with traditional Christian beliefs asks, "Do Mormons believe in the Trinity?" or "What do you believe about God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit?"

**Preparation Focus:** How can you clearly and respectfully explain the Latter-day Saint understanding of the Godhead, acknowledging the difference from the traditional Trinity doctrine?

**Consider Discussing:**
- Acknowledge their question and the term "Trinity."
- Explain the belief in God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost as three distinct, separate Beings (the Godhead).
- Emphasize Their perfect unity in purpose, love, and work.
- Share scriptural examples that illustrate Their separateness and unity (e.g., Christ's baptism, the First Vision, Christ's intercessory prayer in John 17).
