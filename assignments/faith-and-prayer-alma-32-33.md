# Weekly Scripture and Prayer Assignment

**This week's reading assignment** is **Alma 32-33** from the Book of Mormon and listening to the prophet's most recent conference talk. The assignment is split into seven days, with specific instructions for reading and praying each day.

## Daily Routine

### 1. Begin with Prayer
Before starting your study, **kneel in prayer** and ask Heavenly Father for guidance to understand the scriptures and their meaning. Pray specifically for help in applying the teachings to your life.

Remember, regular scripture study is more important than a few more minutes of sleep. Seriously. (There's a source for that from a talk smewhere, I need to find it.)

### 2. Scripture Reading
Each day, read your assigned portion of **Alma 32-33**. To do this:

1. **Pray** to start your study. Ask for the spirit, and for help understanding.
1. **Read the assigned verses** once through, focusing on understanding what is being taught.
2. **Write** what you think the verses mean. 
2. **Pray again**, asking Heavenly Father for greater understanding of what you’ve read.
3. **Reread the same verses** again, now with the added insight and spirit of revelation.
2. **Rewrite** what you think the verses mean. 
4. **Conclude with prayer**, asking for a witness of the truthfulness of what you’ve read and how it applies to your life.

### 3. Listen to President Nelson’s Talk
Throughout the week, in addition to your scripture reading, take time to **listen to listen to the most recent conference talk from the prophet**. Reflect on how this talk relates to your scripture study and personal life.
