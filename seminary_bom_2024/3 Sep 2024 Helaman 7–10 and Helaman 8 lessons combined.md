## Questions to write individually:

- What can you do to gain or better have a testimony of the prophet today?


When Nephi was being questioned by the wicked Nephites, some began to defend him (see Helaman 8:7–8). 
Identify examples of people you know who were bold and unafraid in bearing their testimonies of Jesus Christ and His prophets. Also imagine situations you might face in which you would need to defend the prophet, the Church, and the Savior.
