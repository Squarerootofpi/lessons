## Individually

Tithing prep: Checkmarks, questions, and concerns. 

Think to yourself. Why do you not go to the temple more often than you are currently? Have you turned away thoughts about going to the temple?

Think to yourself. Why do you not do family history more often than you are currently? Have you turned away thoughts about doing family history?

We’ll be sharing these reasons you write in your study journal: 
- Write down 2 reasons why someone may not go to the temple at all or as frequently. These do not have to be your reasons. 
- Write down 2 reasons why someone may not do family history or genealogy. These do not have to be your reasons. 

We’ll share these and write them on the board. :smile:

How interested are you in knowing your ancestors? In participating in family history and temple work?


## Some 2nd coming relevance: 

Read 3 Nephi 25:1–2, looking for what the Savior taught will happen when He returns to earth. The following definitions and interpretations of symbols may be useful.

- Stubble: Stubs of plants remaining in a field after harvest that a farmer would burn away
- Roots: Ancestors
- Branches: Posterity
- Healing in His wings: Healing and protective power of the Lord and of His Atonement
- Calves in stall: Israel will be well-treated and provided for like animals in a stall

Read 3 Nephi 25:5-6

## Address questions and discussion

## Maybe individually? 

What is something you feel the Lord would have you do to continue participating in temple and family history work? What difference will this make in your life?
