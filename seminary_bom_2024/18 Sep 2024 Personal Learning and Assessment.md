Assess your learning 7

## Individually:
President Spencer W. Kimball taught that the most important word in the dictionary could be remember. (See “Circles of Exaltation” [address to Church Educational System religious educators, June 28, 1968], 5.)
- Why do you think President Kimball said what he did about the word remember?
- Write down a sentence answering and a sentence explaining why it's important for you to remember.


Goal: explain the role of prophets, evaluate your attitudes and desires, and reflect on plans you have made to apply gospel teachings.

## 2 groups:

The account of Nephi (Helaman 7–11) or Samuel the Lamanite (Helaman 13–15). Review their stories in the associated chapters by scanning the verses and looking at chapter headings or notes you may have made in your study journal.
- How could you use this story to explain the role of prophets to your friend?
- What verses from the scriptures might you include as part of your explanation?
- What are some additional truths or personal experiences you could share to help your friend understand the importance of prophets?

Specifically, potentially see:
Nephi: Helaman 7:29; 8:22–23; 10:4–7; 11:23; 
Samuel: 13:5; and 14:11–12.

## 3 groups: 
Discuss one of the stories (depending on your group): 
- Lehonti/Amalickiah, Captain Moroni and his fortifications, and Helaman’s counsel to his sons
- Discuss what you remember from that story that helps you understand how to have a good foundation in Christ and withstand Satan’s attacks.

- What have you done in recent weeks to remember the Lord and all He has done for you? How do you feel remembering the Lord has helped you remain humble?
- Are there any changes you want to make to help you remember the Lord every day and increase in humility?

## Individually: 
#### 0. Silently say a prayer to heavenly father.
#### 1. Evaluate your study journal (and/or gospel library notes). Go through what you have written. Consider what you have learned in the past few months about the gospel. 
#### 2. What successes have you experienced in your efforts to build your foundation on Jesus Christ? Write at least one down.
#### 3. What obstacles have you seen in building a strong foundation? How have you tried to overcome them? Write at least one down.
#### 4. How have you been blessed for working on building your foundation on Jesus Christ? What difference has it made for you? Write at least one down.
#### 5-8. Read Helaman 5:12 again, and prayerfully pick one thing to do, whether it is something you are stopping or starting, that you feel is **is the most important thing** God wants you (or would want you) to do on a regular basis right now to strengthen your foundation in Christ. Write it down.
#### 9-10. Make reminders or plan to make reminders and other behavior plans to help you achieve your goal of strengthening your foundation.
