Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ love you and will help you in your efforts to stay on the covenant path, which leads back to Them. Take a moment to remember the covenants you have already made with Them and the ways you are striving to keep those covenants. (Briefly review the covenants we make at baptism and renew through the sacrament: [Mosiah 18:8–10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18?lang=eng&id=p8-p10#p8) and [Moroni 4:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/4?lang=eng&id=p3#p3).)


Now, to each member of the Church I say, keep on the covenant path. Your commitment to follow the Savior by making covenants with Him and then keeping those covenants will open the door to every spiritual blessing and privilege available to men, women, and children everywhere. (Russell M. Nelson, “[As We Go Forward Together](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2018/04/as-we-go-forward-together?lang=eng&id=p12#p12),” Ensign, Apr. 2018, 7)
