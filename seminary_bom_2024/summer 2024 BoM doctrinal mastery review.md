## First, an introduction from brother Steed...

Doctrinal Mastery focuses on two outcomes:

1. Learn and apply divine principles for acquiring spiritual knowledge. Heavenly Father has revealed principles for acquiring spiritual knowledge. These principles include acting in faith, examining concepts and questions with an eternal perspective, and seeking further understanding through divinely appointed sources. We develop doctrinal mastery as we apply these principles during and outside of class and seek answers to doctrinal, personal, social, and historical questions in a way that invites the Holy Ghost to strengthen our faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.
2. Master the doctrinal mastery scripture passages and the doctrine of the gospel of Jesus Christ that they teach. This outcome is achieved by:
   1. **Knowing the doctrine** taught in the doctrinal mastery scripture passages.
   2. **Explaining the doctrine clearly** using the associated doctrinal mastery scripture passages.
   3. **Being able to remember and locate the doctrinal mastery scripture passages and memorize the key scripture phrases**.
   4. **Applying the doctrine of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the principles of acquiring spiritual knowledge in our daily choices and in our responses to doctrinal, personal, social, and historical issues and questions.**


## Make the Scriptures Work for You:

Each scripture: 
- Write or mark the reference
- Write the key phrase
- Write how would this affect your life or your choices if...
   - You did not know this doctrine?
   - You knew this verse was true?

**Mosiah 18:8–10**: Be “baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness … that ye have entered into a covenant with him.”

> 8 And it came to pass that he said unto them: Behold, here are the waters of Mormon (for thus were they called) and now, as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another’s burdens, that they may be light;

> 9 Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal life—

> 10 Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?

**Alma 7:11–13**: “And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind.”

> 11 And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.

> 12 And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.

> 13 Now the Spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of God suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his people, that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance; and now behold, this is the testimony which is in me.

**Alma 34:9–10**: “There must be an atonement made, … an infinite and eternal sacrifice.”

> 9 For it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for according to the great plan of the Eternal God there must be an atonement made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all are hardened; yea, all are fallen and are lost, and must perish except it be through the atonement which it is expedient should be made.

> 10 For it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man, neither of beast, neither of any manner of fowl; for it shall not be a human sacrifice; but it must be an infinite and eternal sacrifice.

**Alma 39:9**: “Go no more after the lusts of your eyes.”

> 9 Now my son, I would that ye should repent and forsake your sins, and go no more after the lusts of your eyes, but cross yourself in all these things; for except ye do this ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God. Oh, remember, and take it upon you, and cross yourself in these things.




## Kahoot 

Well, if you read before we start kahoot, you may be one of those skip-to-the-end-of-the-book kind of people. Don't take it personally, the technology won't judge you. ;)
