Mormon 1–2: The Prophet Mormon



## Group 1: Being Sober

Read Mormon 1:2, 15, and consider marking the word “sober.” (You might record in your scriptures that sober can mean reverent, serious, and thoughtful.)

President Boyd K. Packer
We have watched patterns of reverence and irreverence in the Church. While many are to be highly commended, we are drifting. We have reason to be deeply concerned. …

Irreverence suits the purposes of the adversary by obstructing the delicate channels of revelation in both mind and spirit. (Boyd K. Packer, “Reverence Invites Revelation,” Ensign, Nov. 1991, 22)

What are some things that should be treated with reverence and seriousness that are treated irreverently by some?

What are some ways the Savior exemplifies being sober (reverent, serious, and thoughtful)?



## Group 2: Being Quick to Observe

Read Mormon 1:2 and consider marking the phrase “quick to observe.”

Elder David A. Bednar
When we are quick to observe, we promptly look or notice and obey. Both of these fundamental elements—looking and obeying—are essential to being quick to observe. And the prophet Mormon is an impressive example of this gift in action. (David A. Bednar, “Quick to Observe,” Ensign, Dec. 2006, 32)

What advice would you give to a friend who feels that obedience to the Lord can wait until later in life?
