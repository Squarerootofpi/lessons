## Game rules:
- You will be assigned on a team when you arrive.
- You will hear scenarios of what a friend of yours from school says to you. 
- When the facilitator says "go", you may begin working to get points through paper airplane production and/or writing the references.
### Getting points with the doctrinal mastery:
- You will respond by writing the reference and the phrase on the whiteboard of one of the last 12 doctrinal mastery references. Whichever team writes the correct reference first gets a point, and the team which also has the reference with the correct phrase (ellipsis included) first gets another point. 
- At any point, a person going up to the board can get confirmation that what they have written so far is correct or incorrect by asking the facilitator. This is how you actually get the point of the correct reference first, and make sure you are writing the correct reference on the board.
### Additional methods for getting points: 
- Each team has 4 pieces of paper. For every paper airplane made and thrown from the designated line (only one throw attempt for each paper, so each paper can only be made into one paper airplane and thrown only once), your team gets 2 points. 
### Constraints:
- Only one person can be up at the whiteboard at a time. They canâ€™t bring anything with them, 
- Paper airplanes must look like airplanes and must have wings. :smile: 
- You must rotate through team members in a cycle. Team members cannot speak to other team members when they are trying to write, and must stay seated (unless throwing paper airplanes). 
- If the scripture reference and phrase is incorrect, before going to sit down, the person must erase the whole thing, references included. 
- No paper airplane work (throwing or creating) or scripture writing can be done while after either team correctly finishes the full reference and phrase. Paper airplane work (and writing) can only happen after the team finishes.
- Once a team has gotten the full reference and phrase, paper airplane work must freeze untl the next round starts (the facilitator says "go")

In a wimpier version, groups only had to erase 5 words, but this was problematic. So, now the scripture reference counts as 2 words (one for the book, and one for the chapter/verse).
