## Group 1 
The brother of Jared “did molten out of a rock sixteen small stones,” carried them to “the top of the mount, and cried again unto the Lord” (Ether 3:1). Discuss (and prepare to share) why you feel being willing to act and do what we can to solve the problem is an important part of our faith in the Lord.
## Group 2 
As the brother of Jared prayed, he spoke of “his weakness before [God]” (Ether 3:2) and humbly asked for help. Discuss (and prepare to share) how understanding our own weakness and our total dependance on the Lord can affect our prayers and our faith in Him.
## Group 3 
As the brother of Jared asked the Lord to touch the stones to make them shine, he testified, “I know, O Lord, that thou hast all power, and can do whatsoever thou wilt for the benefit of man” (Ether 3:4). Discuss (and prepare to share) how you have come to know or could come to know that the Lord has the power to help us with our problems. You might include how that knowledge can affect our faith in Him.
## Group 4
The brother of Jared promised that he would believe the words the Lord would speak in the future (see Ether 3:11–12). Discuss (and prepare to share) why you think the brother of Jared trusted in the Lord so much that he agreed to this.


## Jeffrey R. Holland:
“Redemptive faith must often be exercised toward experiences in the future[.] … Faith is to agree unconditionally—and in advance—to whatever conditions God may require in both the near and distant future” (Jeffrey R. Holland, Christ and the New Covenant: The Messianic Message of the Book of Mormon [1997], 18–19).

God “knoweth all things, and there is not anything save he knows it” [2 Nephi 9:20]. … Nevertheless, God has frequently asked questions of mortals, usually as a way to test their faith, measure their honesty, or develop their knowledge. (Jeffrey R. Holland, Christ and the New Covenant: The Messianic Message of the Book of Mormon [1997], 19–20)
