## Individual Starter Activity: 

Imagine you have a friend who has become interested in the Church. Your friend tells you he has a good feeling about what he has learned and experienced so far. He wants to know what he should do next to follow the Savior more fully.
- What might you invite your friend to do? Why?


## Today, we’re gonna make a lesson. :D

First, read Nephi’s words way back forever ago:

2 nephi 31:21


On a blank page, you’re going to make this quick lesson (mini concept lesson) using this outline. Write the bolded parts as an outline and write down briefly an answer that will help you say it to someone else:

**Core Verses**: Write down the 3-5 verses you need to demonstrate these points. You won’t share these in class, but you would as a missionary. 

**Summary**: From what you have learned and studied, write a summary of the doctrine of Christ. This should be just a few short bullet points.

**Good Questions**: List two or three questions you could ask to help those you teach to understand and think more deeply about the doctrine of Christ.

**Personal Feels/Experience**: Describe why you feel it is important to follow these teachings of the Savior. If possible, include experiences you have had that demonstrate how these teachings have blessed your life.

**Invitations**: List one or two invitations you could extend to help those you teach apply what they have learned about the doctrine of Christ.

**Activity**: (Optional) Think of an object or activity to help those you teach better understand the doctrine of Christ.


Then, read Christ’s words, and fill out your lesson plan. :smile:

Verses 31-41: Christ declaring his doctrine


The pure doctrine of Christ is powerful. It changes the life of everyone who understands it and seeks to implement it in his or her life. The doctrine of Christ helps us find and stay on the covenant path. Staying on that narrow but well-defined path will ultimately qualify us to receive all that God has. Nothing could be worth more than all our Father has! (Russell M. Nelson, “Pure Truth, Pure Doctrine, and Pure Revelation,” Liahona, Nov. 2021, 6)

## Individual Pondering/Conclude: 

Take some time to ponder how you can apply the doctrine of Christ to your life each day. The following self-assessment can help you identify ways you are currently living the Savior’s doctrine, as well as ways you could improve.

Respond to each of the following statements with one of these answers: “regularly,” “sometimes,” or “rarely.”
- I exercise faith in Jesus Christ by striving to keep the commandments and trust that He can help me overcome my challenges.
- I repent daily for my mistakes and seek for the Savior’s power to help me become more like Him.
- I strive to keep my baptismal covenants and weekly renew that effort by worthily partaking of the sacrament.
- I invite the Holy Ghost into my life through regular prayer to Heavenly Father and study and seek to act on spiritual promptings.
