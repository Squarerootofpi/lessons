Prep: Make a list of things that inspire or remind you to keep the commandments of God.

### Questions to think on:

#### When have you forgotten something important? What happened as a result?

#### What are some earthly things that you never want to forget? Why?

#### What are some spiritual things that you never want to forget? Why?



### How did the Nephites react to their victory? Why?

> 1 Behold, now it came to pass that the people of Nephi were exceedingly rejoiced, because the Lord had again delivered them out of the hands of their enemies; therefore they gave thanks unto the Lord their God; yea, and they did fast much and pray much, and they did worship God with exceedingly great joy.

> 7 And there were many in the church who believed in the flattering words of Amalickiah, therefore they dissented even from the church; and thus were the affairs of the people of Nephi exceedingly precarious and dangerous, notwithstanding their great victory which they had had over the Lamanites, and their great rejoicings which they had had because of their deliverance by the hand of the Lord.
> 8 Thus we see how quick the children of men do forget the Lord their God, yea, how quick to do iniquity, and to be led away by the evil one.
> 9 Yea, and we also see the great wickedness one very wicked man can cause to take place among the children of men.
> 10 Yea, we see that Amalickiah, because he was a man of cunning device and a man of many flattering words, that he led away the hearts of many people to do wickedly; yea, and to seek to destroy the church of God, and to destroy the foundation of liberty which God had granted unto them, or which blessing God had sent upon the face of the land for the righteous’ sake.
> 11 And now it came to pass that when Moroni, who was the chief commander of the armies of the Nephites, had heard of these dissensions, he was angry with Amalickiah.
> 12 And it came to pass that he rent his coat; and he took a piece thereof, and wrote upon it—In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children—and he fastened it upon the end of a pole.

### Why do you think Moroni chose to display these words for others to see during this difficult time?

### How do you see one or more of these items being forgotten or de-emphasized in the world today?



# Religious Freedom

Question to think on during the rest of class, comments anytime. :smile:

## What is the most difficult thing to deal with regarding your religion in public? 

### President Dallin H. Oaks of the First Presidency taught:

> If we cease valuing our churches for any reason, we threaten our personal spiritual life, and significant numbers separating themselves from God reduce His blessings to our nations.

> Attendance and activity in a church help us become better people and better influences on the lives of others. In church we are taught how to apply religious principles. We learn from one another. …

> … I pray that we will all be steadfast in these Church experiences as we seek eternal life, the greatest of all the gifts of God. (Dallin H. Oaks, “The Need for a Church,” Liahona, Nov. 2021, 24, 26)


#### How important is it to have friends who believe in Christ as you do? 

### Elder Ronald A. Rasband of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught:

> What is religious freedom?
> It is freedom of worship in all its configurations: freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, freedom to act on personal beliefs, and freedom for others to do the same. Religious freedom allows each of us to decide for ourselves what we believe, how we live and act according to our faith, and what God expects of us. …
> I invite you to champion the cause of religious freedom. It is an expression of the God-given principle of agency.
> Religious freedom brings balance to competing philosophies. The good of religion, its reach, and the daily acts of love which religion inspires only multiply when we protect the freedom to express and act on core beliefs. (Ronald A. Rasband, “To Heal the World,” Liahona, May 2022, 91, 93)

### Elder Ronald A. Rasband of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught on another occasion:

> There is [a] scourge sweeping the globe: attacks on your and my religious freedom. This growing sentiment seeks to remove religion and faith in God from the public square, schools, community standards, and civic discourse. Opponents of religious freedom seek to impose restrictions on expressions of heartfelt convictions. They even criticize and ridicule faith traditions.
> Such an attitude marginalizes people, devaluing personal principles, fairness, respect, spirituality, and peace of conscience. (Ronald A. Rasband, “To Heal the World,” Liahona, May 2022, 91)


## What can we express of our religion in our schools?
