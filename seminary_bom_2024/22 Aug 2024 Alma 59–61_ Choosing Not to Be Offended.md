Beginning to 2:35, and then 4:21-5:10

- What are some other reasons we may be tempted to feel offended?
- How does getting offended affect us?

## In your study journal:
1. When have you been tempted to feel the most offended, or when were you recently offended? 
2. Why were you tempted, and how would being offended have affected you, regardless of how you responded?
3. How did the way you felt and acted affect your relationships with others and with the Lord?

## 3 Groups: Examples of when people have been offended or could have been offended and how they reacted:

As a group: 
1. Read the verses or paragraphs associated with your scenario
2. Discuss the questions for your group and scenario
3. Decide which group members will share with the class

Questions; different group members share with the class:
1. Who is offending whom and how they are offending them. 
2. How we might be tempted to react if we were in this situation.
3. How did the person react, and what we can learn from their reaction.

What are the principal reasons why we take offense when someone says/does something? 

Can we offend ourselves?

The savior is our example

Study journal:
- Take a few minutes to write a letter to your future self. What advice would you give yourself on how to respond when someone says or does something hurtful or offensive? Include what you learned from the Savior and Pahoran that you could apply in that situation. - Also include how you might seek the Lord’s help.
