[Book of Mormon] prophets, as inspired by the Lord, saw our day and selected the doctrine and truths that would help us most. The Book of Mormon is our latter-day survival guide. (Russell M. Nelson, “Embrace the Future with Faith,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2020, 75)

## As a pair
Read each set of verses out loud. After reading each set of verses, Do the following steps together.
- Read Helaman 3:27–30; 6:34–36 to work togeether to identify the “thus we see” statements of truth. 
- Each of you mark those phrases in your scriptures.

## As a ½ Class group
Next, choose one of the truths you found, and list some of the spiritual dangers, challenges, or attacks on faith that this truth can help you survive.
- Someone scribe for the group and write the spiritual dangers, challenges, or attacks on faith on the whiteboard. 
- Someone else speak for the group and explain the ones they put up on the board

## Individually
On a piece of paper write “How to survive …” and finish the statement with one of the dangers, challenges, or attacks you listed. For example, if you used the previously identified truth, you could write, “How to survive an attack on a spiritual impression.” Use the truth you chose to create a one-page survival guide. Explain in drawings or words how this truth can help a teenager survive spiritually. Incorporate at least **two** of the following ideas into your survival guide:
- Why this truth can help someone spiritually survive the difficulty you listed
- Other scriptures that relate to this truth or help with the difficulty you listed
- How this truth brings you or others to Jesus Christ or helps you receive His strength
- What could happen to people if this truth is not known or not followed
- How the world would change if everyone chose to live by this truth


## With time:

## Extra notes


You may find the following truths today, and others. 
The Lord is merciful to all who call upon Him with sincere hearts (see Helaman 3:27).
The gate of heaven is open to all who believe in Jesus Christ (see Helaman 3:28).
Anyone who desires can study the word of God, which will lead them to the kingdom of God (see Helaman 3:29–30).
The better we know God, the more likely we are to keep His commandments (see Helaman 6:34).
If we are wicked and harden our hearts, then the Spirit of the Lord will withdraw from us (see Helaman 6:35).
If we choose to willingly believe in the Lord’s words, then He will pour out His Spirit upon us (see Helaman 6:36).
