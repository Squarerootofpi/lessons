Look for what Amalickiah’s plans were as he went among the Lamanites.

And... Think, constantly, who different people could represent in this story. :smile:

> 1 Now we will return in our record to Amalickiah and those who had fled with him into the wilderness; for, behold, he had taken those who went with him, and went up in the land of Nephi among the Lamanites, and did stir up the Lamanites to anger against the people of Nephi, insomuch that the king of the Lamanites sent a proclamation throughout all his land, among all his people, that they should gather themselves together again to go to battle against the Nephites.

> 2 And it came to pass that when the proclamation had gone forth among them they were exceedingly afraid; yea, they feared to displease the king, and they also feared to go to battle against the Nephites lest they should lose their lives. And it came to pass that they would not, or the more part of them would not, obey the commandments of the king.

> 3 And now it came to pass that the king was wroth because of their disobedience; therefore he gave Amalickiah the command of that part of his army which was obedient unto his commands, and commanded him that he should go forth and compel them to arms.

> 4 Now behold, this was the desire of Amalickiah; for he being a very subtle man to do evil therefore he laid the plan in his heart to dethrone the king of the Lamanites.

> 5 And now he had got the command of those parts of the Lamanites who were in favor of the king; and he sought to gain favor of those who were not obedient; therefore he went forward to the place which was called Onidah, for thither had all the Lamanites fled; for they discovered the army coming, and, supposing that they were coming to destroy them, therefore they fled to Onidah, to the place of arms.

> 6 And they had appointed a man to be a king and a leader over them, being fixed in their minds with a determined resolution that they would not be subjected to go against the Nephites.

> 7 And it came to pass that they had gathered themselves together upon the top of the mount which was called Antipas, in preparation to battle.

> 8 Now it was not Amalickiah’s intention to give them battle according to the commandments of the king; but behold, it was his intention to gain favor with the armies of the Lamanites, that he might place himself at their head and dethrone the king and take possession of the kingdom.

### What did Amalickiah do to gain influence and power among the Lamanites?

### How are Amalickiah’s goals similar to Satan’s? (see [2 Nephi 26:22](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p22#p22)).

> 22 And there are also secret combinations, even as in times of old, according to the combinations of the devil, for he is the founder of all these things; yea, the founder of murder, and works of darkness; yea, and he leadeth them by the neck with a flaxen cord, until he bindeth them with his strong cords forever.

### How are Heavenly Father’s goals for you different from Satan’s? (see [Moses 1:39](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/1?lang=eng&id=p39#p39)). 

> 39 For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.

### Why is this important to remember?


## Lehonti... 

[Alma 47:9–12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/47?lang=eng&id=p9-p12#p9)

> 9 And behold, it came to pass that he caused his army to pitch their tents in the valley which was near the mount Antipas.

> 10 And it came to pass that when it was night he sent a secret embassy into the mount Antipas, desiring that the leader of those who were upon the mount, whose name was Lehonti, that he should come down to the foot of the mount, for he desired to speak with him.

> 11 And it came to pass that when Lehonti received the message he durst not go down to the foot of the mount. And it came to pass that Amalickiah sent again the second time, desiring him to come down. And it came to pass that Lehonti would not; and he sent again the third time.

> 12 And it came to pass that when Amalickiah found that he could not get Lehonti to come down off from the mount, he went up into the mount, nearly to Lehonti’s camp; and he sent again the fourth time his message unto Lehonti, desiring that he would come down, and that he would bring his guards with him.

### What did Amalickiah want Lehonti to do?

### Why do you think he wanted that? 

### What are some reasons Lehonti might have considered accepting Amalickiah’s final invitation in verse 12?

### What would you have told Lehonti if you had been in his army and he had asked you for advice about whether to meet Amalickiah? Why?


[Read Alma 47:13–19](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/47?lang=eng&id=p13-p19#p13)

> 13 And it came to pass that when Lehonti had come down with his guards to Amalickiah, that Amalickiah desired him to come down with his army in the night-time, and surround those men in their camps over whom the king had given him command, and that he would deliver them up into Lehonti’s hands, if he would make him (Amalickiah) a second leader over the whole army.

> 14 And it came to pass that Lehonti came down with his men and surrounded the men of Amalickiah, so that before they awoke at the dawn of day they were surrounded by the armies of Lehonti.

> 15 And it came to pass that when they saw that they were surrounded, they pled with Amalickiah that he would suffer them to fall in with their brethren, that they might not be destroyed. Now this was the very thing which Amalickiah desired.

> 16 And it came to pass that he delivered his men, contrary to the commands of the king. Now this was the thing that Amalickiah desired, that he might accomplish his designs in dethroning the king.

> 17 Now it was the custom among the Lamanites, if their chief leader was killed, to appoint the second leader to be their chief leader.

> 18 And it came to pass that Amalickiah caused that one of his servants should administer poison [by degrees](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/21?lang=eng#p16?id=p16) to Lehonti, that he died.

> 19 Now, when Lehonti was dead, the Lamanites appointed Amalickiah to be their leader and their chief commander.

### How are these tactics similar to Satan's?


# What about us?


What are some ways you are tempted to come down?

When have you resisted Satan’s temptations by using the tools the Lord has provided you with?

How will you strive to better seek God’s help to resist Satan’s temptations?
