## Discussion and reading: 

One effective way to study the teachings of the Lord is to look for cause-and-effect relationships. Many times, these statements begin with the word if. These statements can help you see clearly which choices lead to which results. In speaking of cause-and-effect (or conditional) statements, Elder Kevin S. Hamilton of the Seventy declared:

The Lord also operates through conditions: conditions of faith, conditions of righteousness, conditions of repentance. There are many examples of conditional statements from God such as: …

“If ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, [then] he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost” (Moroni 10:4). …

“If ye keep my commandments, [then] ye shall abide in my love” (John 15:10). (Kevin S. Hamilton, “Then Will I Make Weak Things Become Strong,” Liahona, May 2022, 50, brackets and emphasis in the original)
