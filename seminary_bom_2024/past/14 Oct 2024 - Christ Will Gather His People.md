## Individually: 

1. Take a moment to think of situations in which you or those you know felt lonely, unsafe, or like you did not belong.
2. Write down the answer to the following questions: 
   1. How might being part of a group help with these concerns and feelings?
   2. What are the advantages to being in a group with the Lord and those who follow Him? 
3. Prepare one thing you can share with the class from this activity that might help someone else, that you thought about in this activity. 

## Discuss
- Sharing 
- Why do you think the Lord has repeatedly instructed His people to gather physically and spiritually?


## Context: 

- The Lord previously promised Abraham and his descendants, including Jacob (also named Israel), that they would have access to all the blessings of the gospel and the priesthood (see Abraham 2:6–11).
- Israel’s descendants, including the Nephites, had been scattered throughout the world. The Lord promised to gather them again to receive the blessings of the gospel.
- Any who join the Church who are not literal descendants of Israel are adopted into Israel and can receive all of the same blessings.


## What did the Lord Promise to do? (groups)

3 Nephi 20:11–13, 18, 22

https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/20?lang=eng&id=p11-p13,18,22#p11

- Prepare to share with the class 1-2 things the Lord promised to do. (especially 13,18,22)


## As a class: 
What are some ways the Lord is bringing us “to the knowledge of the Lord … who hath redeemed [us]”? (v13)

How do those who follow the Savior have “the powers of heaven … in [their] midst” now? (3 Nephi 20:22). 

In what ways can we have the Lord “in the midst of” us? (3 Nephi 20:22).

How can these blessings help us in our lives (including when we feel lonely, unsafe, or like we do not belong)?


## additional discussion time: 
3 Nephi 21:1–2, 7

Why do you think the Lord wants us to recognize the signs of His gathering?

What other signs of Christ’s gathering are you aware of?

## Individual Ponder: [~8-10 min]
- Read for several minutes in the Book of Mormon, looking for verses or phrases that help you come to the Lord, feel His love, and gain the blessings He offers. Record the references or key phrases in your study journal. Think of ways you might share these verses with others.
- Prepare what you might say or write to share the Book of Mormon with someone. Include your feelings about the book and how you think it could help them come closer to the Savior.
- Prepare what you could say to invite someone to attend church or a church activity with you. Include your thoughts on how it could help them, especially how it could help them come closer to the Lord.
