## Individual pre-class engagement activity:

Imagine that someone you just met wanted to know more about you. 
- Ponder to yourself: If they asked each of the following people to write a one-sentence description of something positive about you, what do you think each person would write?
 Someone you consider a friend
 Your parent or guardian
 Your bishop or branch president
- Write a one sentence description of something positive about you that you think God would want to tell you today.

### Small groups: 
3 passages that help teach the process of gaining a testimony.
- 2 Nephi 28:30 and Ether 12:6 and Moroni 10:4–5
For each one: 
- Record what you learn from it in your study journal
- Discuss with each other how it helps you understand the process of gaining a testimony
- Prepare to share at least 3 things you learned as a group; different people should share


### Individually: 
Pick one of the doctrinal mastery passages that you most want to memorize. If you have already done this previously, and you have the same one, use that.

Write down it and the scriptural phrase as many times as you can on a scratch portion of your study journal until time runs out. :smile:


### Individually

1. Write down a topic you want to learn more about. 
2. Choose and read at least two Book of Mormon doctrinal mastery passages that relate to the passage or topic you chose to study. Write how each passage increases your understanding of the passage or topic you selected. If you think your topic is weird or tough, ask for help.
3. Choose and read at least two additional doctrinal mastery passages from other scripture courses that add to your understanding of the Book of Mormon passage or topic you selected. Write how each passage increases your understanding of the Book of Mormon passage or topic you selected.
