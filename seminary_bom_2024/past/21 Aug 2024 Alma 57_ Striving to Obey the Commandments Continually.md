## Ponder/Write: 

What is your attitude toward keeping the commandments of God? Why does your attitude matter? 

If you are not currently striving to keep the commandments the best you can, what is keeping you from doing so?

## Scripture Study skills: 

Two scripture study skills that can deepen your study of this account and help you apply its lessons to your life are to identify and ponder important words or phrases.

### As a small group, Instructions:

4. Search and define key words and phrases.
5. Discuss those.

[Alma 57:21–23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/57?lang=eng&id=p21-p23#p21)

[Alma 58:40](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/58?lang=eng&id=p40#p40)

# As a pair:

[Alma 57:24–27](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/57?lang=eng&id=p24-p27#p24)

How can knowing that there is “a just God” who has “miraculous” and “marvelous power” (Alma 57:26) affect our attitude toward obeying Him?

What attitude do you think the Lord might want us to have when we strive to keep His commandments but fall short of perfect obedience? How does your understanding of the Atonement of Jesus Christ help answer this question?


Key Point: if we put our trust in God and strive to keep His commands continually, then He will bless us by His marvelous power.


### 1 or 2 of three individually: 
Read at least two of the following passages to increase your understanding of the purposes of God’s commandments and how He may bless you for your obedience: [Abraham 3:25](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&id=p25#p25); [John 14:15](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/14?lang=eng&id=p15#p15); [Mosiah 2:41](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2?lang=eng&id=p41#p41); [Alma 9:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/9?lang=eng&id=p13#p13).

Think of examples of the Savior’s obedience to Heavenly Father, and ponder what you learn from His example. Elder Robert D. Hales (1932–2017) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles taught that “our love of the Savior is the key to Savior-like obedience” (“[If Ye Love Me, Keep My Commandments](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2014/04/if-ye-love-me-keep-my-commandments?lang=eng&id=p17#p17),” Ensign or Liahona, May 2014, 37). Think of some of the reasons you love the Savior and how that love affects your attitude toward obeying the commandments.

Reflect on ways you have been obedient to God’s commandments and the blessings He has given you for your obedience.
