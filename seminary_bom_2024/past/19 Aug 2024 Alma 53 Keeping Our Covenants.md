### Current Covenants for me:

Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ love you and will help you in your efforts to stay on the covenant path, which leads back to Them. Take a moment to remember the covenants you have already made with Them and the ways you are striving to keep those covenants. (Briefly review the covenants we make at baptism and renew through the sacrament: [Mosiah 18:8–10](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18?lang=eng&id=p8-p10#p8) and [Moroni 4:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/4?lang=eng&id=p3#p3).)


Now, to each member of the Church I say, keep on the covenant path. Your commitment to follow the Savior by making covenants with Him and then keeping those covenants will open the door to every spiritual blessing and privilege available to men, women, and children everywhere. (Russell M. Nelson, “[As We Go Forward Together](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2018/04/as-we-go-forward-together?lang=eng&id=p12#p12),” Ensign, Apr. 2018, 7)



## People of Ammon

Their covenant and conumdrum:

The people of Ammon were at a critical moment of their spiritual lives. They had been true to their covenant never to take up arms. But they understood that fathers are responsible to provide protection to their families. That need seemed great enough to merit consideration of breaking their covenant. (Richard G. Scott, “[Personal Strength through the Atonement of Jesus Christ](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2013/10/personal-strength-through-the-atonement-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng&id=p7#p7),” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2013, 82)





### Helaman's counsel to the people of Ammon in this situation:

### Introspection: 

How determined am I to keep my covenants I've already made with God? 

How determined am I to make covenants with God that lie ahead of me still? 

Record in your study journal what you learned or felt today that could increase your resolve to stay on the path back to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. You may include any temptations or distractions you face on your covenant path and how your determination and your trust in the Lord may help you overcome them.
