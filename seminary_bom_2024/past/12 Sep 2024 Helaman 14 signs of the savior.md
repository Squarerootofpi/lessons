### Half of the class:
- Signs of His birth: Helaman 14:2–8
- Signs of His death: Helaman 14:14–15, 20–27
- As a group prepare to share (have 3 different people share these 3 things): 
  - An overview of the signs
  - What symbols do these signs have in them that you notice? 
  - How might seeing these signs have affirmed the Nephites’ belief in the Savior?

Hmmm. Music.

### Dallin H. Oaks:
What if the day of His coming were tomorrow? If we knew that we would meet the Lord tomorrow—through our premature death or through His unexpected coming—what would we do today? What confessions would we make? What practices would we discontinue? What accounts would we settle? What forgivenesses would we extend? What testimonies would we bear?
If we would do those things then, why not now? Why not seek peace while peace can be obtained? (Dallin H. Oaks, “Preparation for the Second Coming,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2004, 9)

Signs of the second coming
- 1 Nephi 14:14
- 2 Nephi 3:6, 11, 15
- Isaiah 2:2–3
- Matthew 24:14
- 2 Timothy 3:1–7


Individually: 
- Write what signs you have seen of the 2nd coming. (spend a minute)
- Spend 30 seconds pondering how Christ’s restored church, temples, the Book of Mormon, etc. have affected your belief in Christ.
- Write: How has the fulfillment of these signs affirmed your faith in the Savior?

Questions for us all:
- According to Helaman 14:13, 28–29, why is it so important for us to believe in Christ?

Individually: In what ways has your belief in Jesus Christ been a blessing to you?


Video if want to: look to the light. People found light Christ offers.
