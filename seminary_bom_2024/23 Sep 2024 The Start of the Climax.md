## Individual starter activity: 
We are talking about the climax of the Book of Mormon now. 
- To help you organize these truths, create a heading in your study journal titled: Learning about Jesus Christ in 3 Nephi. You may want to reserve multiple pages in your study journal so you can add truths to this list during your study of the Savior’s ministry among the Nephites over the next few weeks. If you exclusively use digital study journals, make a notebook or a tag to collect these notes. 
- Read the chapter headings of 3 Nephi 1-7. 
   - Write on the board (in marker) one reason it would have been hard to live in these times before the signs of Christ’s death. Write something different than other people. :smile:
- Read the chapter headings of 3 Nephi 8-10.
   - Write in your study journal the strongest emotion you think you would have felt if you had experienced what these people did. 
- Raise your hand when you're done, so I know you're done. :smile:


## Group version: 
Each group study and discuss one of the following scripture passages: 3 Nephi 9:13–18; 3 Nephi 9:19–22; 3 Nephi 10:4–7; and 3 Nephi 10:8–12. Members from each group could be invited to share what they learned about Jesus Christ from the verses they studied.
## Individual version:
Read 3 Nephi 9:13–22 and 10:4–12, looking for what Jesus Christ taught these people about Himself. Write these truths under the heading in your study journal.


What did the Savior teach about Himself that was especially significant to you? Why?
How can the truths you have learned about Jesus Christ impact your love for and trust in Him?
What situations have you been in, or might you be in, where remembering one or more of these truths will be important?

## The Law of Moses and Sacrifice

Read 3 Nephi 9:19–20

- What does it mean to have a broken heart and a contrite spirit?
- Why would the Savior ask us to offer a broken heart and a contrite spirit to Him as a sacrifice? 
- Think of experiences you have had where you have felt a broken heart and a contrite spirit?
- What helped you feel that way? 

### Quote by Elder Bruce D. Porter: 

The Savior’s perfect submission to the Eternal Father is the very essence of a broken heart and a contrite spirit. Christ’s example teaches us that a broken heart is an eternal attribute of godliness. When our hearts are broken, we are completely open to the Spirit of God and recognize our dependence on Him for all that we have and all that we are. The sacrifice so entailed is a sacrifice of pride in all its forms. Like malleable clay in the hands of a skilled potter, the brokenhearted can be molded and shaped in the hands of the Master. …

… Those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit are willing to do anything and everything that God asks of them, without resistance or resentment. We cease doing things our way and learn to do them God’s way instead. (Bruce D. Porter, “A Broken Heart and a Contrite Spirit,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2007, 32)

### Quote by Elder Neal A. Maxwell:
“Real, personal sacrifice never was placing an animal on the altar. Instead, it is a willingness to put the animal in us [the natural man] upon the altar and letting it be consumed!” (Neal A. Maxwell, “Deny Yourselves of All Ungodliness,” Ensign, May 1995, 68).
