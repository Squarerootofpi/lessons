### How to understand it? Explain it. How to Explain it? Well... write it and try it. :smile:

1. Open your study journal, make a table of 3 columns (or make something equivalent as a gospel library note). The 2nd column should be small. You can mark today's date at the top of the journal page (16 Aug 2024)
   0. Alternatively, you can highlight the verse(s) in the gospel library app for each verse. Add a tag to each highlight "doctinal mastery" or something else so you can go back to them in the future if you want. Instead just write the notes in there.
1. Write each reference in a row in the 1st column, just the "Alma 7:11-13" portion (from Alma 7 to Moroni 10 )
2. Read each reference, and in the 2nd column write how much you think you understand on a scale of 1-5, 1 being (I don't get it at all, I think it's worthless, or I literally don't believe it), and 5 being (I can defend this like an apologist :smile:)
3. Choose 3 that you could like to learn better, or better understand. The numbers that are the lowest probably. Then, *write why you want to understand that particular one better* in the next column.
4. On the next page, try to write the doctine or important parts of one or two of the passages in your own words.
   1. Identify key words and phrases, especially those that may be misunderstood. Consider looking up definitions or finding cross-references in the scriptures that can help clarify the passage. Why are these key words or phrases so important?
   2. How does this scripture passage connect to the Savior? What do you learn from or about Him? In what ways is He an example of the truths in this passage?
   3. What objects might you use or display to help explain the message of this scripture?
5. Pray to Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ. 
   1. Ask Heavenly Father if you are understanding it correctly. Seek for understanding. 
   2. Ask Him if the words are true.
