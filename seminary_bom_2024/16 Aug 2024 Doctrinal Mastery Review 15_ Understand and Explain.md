## How to understand it? Explain it. How to Explain it? Well... write it and try it. :smile:

0. Open your study journal, make a table of 3 columns (or make something equivalent as a gospel library note). The 2nd column should be small. You can mark today's date at the top of the journal page (16 Aug 2024)
1. Write each reference in a row in the 1st column, just the "Alma 7:11-13" portion (from Alma 7 to Moroni 10 )
2. Read each reference, and in the 2nd column write how much you think you understand on a scale of 1-5, 1 being (I don't get it at all, I think it's worthless, or I literally don't believe it), and 5 being (I can defend this like an apologist :smile:)
3. Choose 3 that you could like to learn better, or better understand. The numbers that are the lowest probably. Then, *write why you want to understand that particular one better* in the next column.
4. On the next page, try to write the doctine or important parts of one or two of the passages in your own words.
