## Individually: 

Think of some people you feel really close to and have a strong relationship with.
- What have you or they done to strengthen those relationships?
Now think about how close you feel to the Savior.

As you study today, invite the Holy Ghost to teach you how to draw closer to the Savior and strengthen your relationship with Him.
