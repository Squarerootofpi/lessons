## Individually in your study journal, write and respond to the following question: 
- Do I see repentance as a gift from God or as a punishment? Why?

### Story read/scenario:
Imagine some friends are trying to find a high mountain lake they have heard about but never visited. As they travel through the wilderness, they meet a man who says he has lived in the area for years. He warns them that the path they are on does not lead to the lake and is dangerous in places. He counsels them to turn around and retrace their steps to a different path that will lead them safely there.
- What are some reasons the friends may not listen to the man?

Prophets warn us and want us to repent.
- What are some reasons we might not repent?

### Individually, answer: 
What are some obstacles you face regarding repentance? How does God want you to overcome them?

Look for some of the attitudes and actions Samuel said the people needed to repent of. What do you notice about their attitude(s)?
In addition to riches, what are some other things we may be tempted to “set [our] hearts upon” and “always remember” more than the Lord?

### President Nelson Quote: 

Too many people consider repentance as punishment—something to be
avoided except in the most serious circumstances. But this feeling of being
penalized is engendered by Satan. He tries to block us from looking to Jesus
Christ, who stands with open arms, hoping and willing to heal, forgive,
cleanse, strengthen, purify, and sanctify us. …

Nothing is more liberating, more ennobling, or more crucial to our individual
progression than is a regular, daily focus on repentance. Repentance is not
an event; it is a process. It is the key to happiness and peace of mind. When
coupled with faith, repentance opens our access to the power of the
Atonement of Jesus Christ. …

When we choose to repent, we choose to change! We allow the Savior to
transform us into the best version of ourselves. We choose to grow spiritually
and receive joy—the joy of redemption in Him. When we choose to repent,
we choose to become more like Jesus Christ! (Russell M. Nelson, “We Can
Do Better and Be Better,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2019, 67)
