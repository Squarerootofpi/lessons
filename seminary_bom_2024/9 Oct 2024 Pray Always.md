## Extra notes

3 Nephi 19:18, 22. Why did the disciples pray to Jesus?

Elder Bruce R. McConkie (1915–1985) of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles explained:

There was a special reason why this was done in this instance and on a onetime basis. Jesus had already taught them to pray in his name to the Father, which they first did. … Jesus was present before them as the symbol of the Father…. Seeing him, it was as though they saw the Father; praying to him, it was as though they prayed to the Father. It was a special and unique situation. (Bruce R. McConkie, The Promised Messiah: The First Coming of Christ [1978], 560–61)
