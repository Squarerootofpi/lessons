## Individual Starting: 

1. Look over the place where you have questions listed that you want to be answered during general conference. Refine or add at least one question to your list of questions. 
2. Make it so that your questions are accessible to you wherever you will be watching conference this weekend. If you need to write them down digitally, make sure that they are digital. You should be able to see your questions during conference and write down answers as you receive revelation.


## Blessings

### Let's have fun with the board -> What are blessings??

## The sermon on the Mount

### Contextualize: 

In 3 Nephi 12–14, Jesus Christ taught the Nephites a sermon very similar to His Sermon on the Mount in the New Testament. President Joseph Fielding Smith (1876–1972) said that the Sermon on the Mount is “the greatest [sermon] that was ever preached, so far as we know” (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Fielding Smith [2013], 234).

Today, as you study the part of the Savior’s sermon called the Beatitudes, you will have the opportunity to learn ways that Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ desire to bless you. President Harold B. Lee (1899–1973) referred to the Savior’s Beatitudes as “the constitution for a perfect life” and explained that “in his Sermon on the Mount the Master has given us somewhat of a revelation of his own character, which was perfect, … and in so doing has given us a blueprint for our own lives” (Decisions for Successful Living [1973], 56–57). As you study, ponder why the blessings Christ offers in this sermon are of far greater worth than any of the blessings the world has to offer.

The beatitudes (in the Americas) are found in 3 Nephi 12:1–12. The word “blessed” in these verses means extremely fortunate or divinely favored.

## Group | Beatitudes

Group 1: 3 Nephi 12:1-5

Group 2: 3 Nephi: 12:6-12

Group instructions: 
1. As a group, read the verses
2. Individually, mark each use of the word “blessing” in these verses in your personal scriptures. Be prepared to share the number of these with the whole class later. 
3. As a group, write all the action-blessing sets on the board. :smile: You may need to send more than one person to help do this. 
4. As a group, pick 2 action-blessing sets you think are really important for all young adults in today’s age. Be prepared to have 2 different people share these. 

## Individual Conclusion: 

Individually, pick an action blessing set you think is important to you right now, and write it down in your study journal. Write down why you think that action blessing pair is important to you at this time.

With time -> The math, M&M’s, and moms
