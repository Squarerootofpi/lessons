## How to Extract If-Then Principles/Statements

This is easy. Anyone can do it. I usually highlight two different colors to help visually see that something is causing something. For me, in these examples from the talks: 
* Red == If 
* Blue == Then

Here is an easy example.

For this, I write: 
* Receiving all things in thankfulness -> Being made glorious

This is a more complex example, where there are two if-then statements, Elder Soares just uses the 1st "then" as the "if" for the second if-then statement.

![ex1](ex1ifthen.png)

For this, I write: 
* Remembering what our eyes have seen and our hearts have felt concerning Christ -> increased amazement at what Christ did
* Increased amazement at what Christ did -> 
  * Healing from our spiritual and emotional wounds 
  * Drawing closer to Christ

# Group Instructions: 
1. Compile the if-then statements as a group
1. One person will act as scribe (they can just use their phone) to write the if-then statements. 
4. As a group, read out loud each paragraph (or the one paragraph), stopping every time you identify if-then statements. 
7. The scribe writes down the if-then statements in their notes. 
9. After finishing, someone in the group writes the truths on the whiteboard. If someone has already written it down, don't write it. (2 minutes)

## Group 1 Paragraphs
P6-9
