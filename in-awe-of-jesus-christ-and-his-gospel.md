## How to Extract If-Then/Cause-Effect Principles/Statements

This is easy. Anyone can do it. I usually highlight two different colors to help visually see that something is causing something. For me, in these examples from the talks: 
* Red == If 
* Blue == Then

Here is an easy example.

For this, I write: 
* Receiving all things in thankfulness -> Being made glorious

This is a more complex example, where there are two if-then statements, Elder Soares just uses the 1st "then" as the "if" for the second if-then statement.

![ex1](ex1ifthen.png)

For this, I write: 
* Remembering what our eyes have seen and our hearts have felt concerning Christ -> increased amazement at what Christ did
* Increased amazement at what Christ did -> 
   * Healing from our spiritual and emotional wounds 
   * Drawing closer to Christ

# Group Instructions: 
1. Compile the if-then/cause-effect statements as a group, and put them on the board. 
   1. Board scribe: Assign another person who will write the statements on the whiteboard
   4. Communication facilitator: Assign another person to help the white-board-writer communicate with the group and board scribe. They make sure the person can write on the board fast and consistently. 
4. As a group, read out loud each assigned paragraph (or the one paragraph), stopping every time you identify if-then statements. 
   8. The communication facilitator tells the board scribe what to write on the board
   9. The board scribe writes them on the board, connecting things with arrows
9. A note: **There are a lot of awesome things... you probably won't have time to write them all down. So pick the most significant ones to your group, and write them down**.
10. You may cheat and see an extended diagram by clicking the "Cheat" link for your group. It would be cooler though if you figured it out as a group though, but it may give you helpful ideas. 😄
