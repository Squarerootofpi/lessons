## How to Extract If-Then Principles/Statements

This is easy. Anyone can do it. I usually highlight two different colors to help visually see that something is causing something. For me, in these examples from the talks: 
* Red == If 
* Blue == Then

Here is an easy example.

This is a more complex example, where there are two if-then statements, Elder Soares just uses the 1st "then" as the "if" for the second if-then statement.

# Group Instructions: 
1. One person will act as scribe (they can just use their phone)
4. Individually, read and ponder the paragraphs assigned to your group, looking for truths. (2 minutes)
6. Going in a circle, each of you say a truth/principle that you learned and categorize it according to President Nelson's categories, until you don't have any more. (2 minutes)
7. The scribe writes down the if then statements and its category in their notes. 
8. Come up with one brief thing as a group you would like to share with the quorum. (1 minute)
9. The scribe writes the truths on the whiteboard. If someone has already written it down, don't write it. (2 minutes)
