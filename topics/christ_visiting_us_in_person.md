You are correct, the previous format was not what you asked for, and the links were incorrect. My apologies for that error.

  * **Doctrine and Covenants (D\&C) References**
      * **D\&C 93:1**
          * **Link:** [D\&C 93:1](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93?lang=eng&id=p1#p1)
          * **Principle:** **Purity and Diligence Lead to Divine Sight.** This scripture contains the Lord's promise that "every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall **see my face and know that I am**." This is a foundational statement that links high levels of personal righteousness to receiving a manifestation of God.
      * **D\&C 97:16**
          * **Link:** [D\&C 97:16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/97?lang=eng&id=p16#p16)
          * **Principle:** **Temple Purity and God's Presence.** The Lord promises that if His people are pure and obedient in building and conducting themselves within a temple, the Lord's "presence shall be there, for it shall come into all our minds by the revelation of the Holy Spirit." While this refers to the presence in the temple, the condition is one of **sanctification** to receive a higher degree of His presence.
      * **D\&C 110:7**
          * **Link:** [D\&C 110:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/110?lang=eng&id=p7#p7)
          * **Principle:** **Visitation for Prophetic Call and Keys.** This verse records a literal, physical appearance of the resurrected Jesus Christ to the Prophet Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery in the Kirtland Temple. Christ identifies Himself, saying: "**I am the first and the last; I am he who liveth, I am he who was slain; I am your advocate with the Father**." This appearance was to accept the temple and confer essential keys of authority.
      * **D\&C 130:3** (Connected to [John 14:21–23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/14?lang=eng&id=p21-p23#p21) )
          * **Link:** [D\&C 130:3](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130?lang=eng&id=p3#p3)
          * **Principle:** **Personal Appearance vs. Spiritual Indwelling (The Second Comforter).** This verse explicitly refutes the idea that the Father and Son merely "dwell in a man's heart," clarifying that Their "appearing... is a **personal appearance**." This teaching is tied to the concept of the **"Second Comforter,"** which is the promise of Christ manifesting Himself personally to the individual who has reached a high level of fidelity.

      * **Ether 3:13–16**
          * **Link:** [Ether 3:13–16](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/3?lang=eng&id=p13-p16#p13)
          * **Principle:** **Faith Pierces the Veil.** This describes the manifestation of the pre-mortal Christ to the **Brother of Jared**. The Lord states that due to the Brother of Jared's "exceeding faith," the veil was unable to withhold anything from his sight. This is a clear scriptural example of **extraordinary faith** resulting in a literal, face-to-face visit.
      * **3 Nephi 12:8**
          * **Link:** [3 Nephi 12:8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12?lang=eng&id=p8#p8)
          * **Principle:** **Purity is the Universal Key.** As part of the Savior's sermon to the Nephites, He declares: "**And blessed are all the pure in heart, for they shall see God**." This is a fundamental, eternal condition for receiving divine manifestation, whether it be a spiritual vision or a personal appearance.
      * **2 Nephi 26:13**
          * **Link:** [2 Nephi 26:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26?lang=eng&id=p13#p13)
          * **Principle:** **Manifestation According to Faith.** This scripture states that God "manifesteth himself unto all those who **believe in him**... working mighty miracles, signs, and wonders, among them, **according to their faith**." While the primary method is the Holy Ghost, this verse confirms that God grants direct spiritual and physical manifestations as a function of the recipient's faith, regardless of their nationality or background.
